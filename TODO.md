# TODO

## Infect/Setup

### Switch to Ansible

Ansible is much better at this than my shell scripts will ever be.

## Vim

### Find a formatter for VimL

This is proving difficult to search for. All I find are formatters that work in
Vim.

### Use `fd` as file scanner

CommandT is not nearly configurable enough to support this. There is an [open
pull request](https://github.com/wincent/command-t/pull/258) that may introduce
the support needed, though.
